## Why are you applying for Financial Aid? (150 words minimum required)
Hello, my name is "your name" and I live in "your country", the country in development. I'm applying for Financial Aid for the course "Course name" because I do not have any special source of income, I don't earn enough money, and I can't afford the full tuition at this time of my life and career.
Receiving Financial Aid for this course will help me get valuable knowledge in "write your career neme like machine learening",  and I have been searching for a job for a long time in order to earn money for this course, but no luck so far, so receiving financial aid will allow me to focus on my studies and by taking it I will be able to get a paid internship and take another course in "your path" path.
I want to invest in my career and my education, but at this moment I can only invest in my time to increase my knowledge and advance in my career, not the money. Hopefully this will change in the upcoming years because I am ambitious, I want to increase my programming knowledge and new technologies, I am eager to work and I hope to advance in my career.

## If you answered no, please help us understand why?
Because there are a lot of developing countries where the average rate of income is low and there are not enough personal needs for home so it isn't enough to get paid courses, and we need a lot of free courses for learning and improving ourselves in order to help develop our countries and benifit humanity.
